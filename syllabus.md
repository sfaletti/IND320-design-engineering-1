## Course Description

### Bulletin Description:

This course focuses on materials, manufacturing methods and the application of this knowledge to the practice of Industrial Design. The course will introduce commonly specified materials, their properties, costs, and impacts on sustainability and commerce. The course will also study the relationship of specific manufacturing methods on formal and aesthetic compositions as well as their relationship of these choices to markets, users and overall product feasibility.

### Detailed Description:

This is a combination lecture/lab course covering the fundamentals of materials and manufacturing processes. Weekly lectures will be reinforced with digital modeling exercises directly associated to the lecture material. Topics will be introduced and discussed in terms of topology, mechanical properties, scale, sustainability and cost.

### Course Goals:

- To become familiar with the range of commonly specified materials.
- To become familiar with the range of commonly specified production processes.
- To understand the impact of scale on cost.
- To understand the impact of scale on sustainability.

#### Student Learning Objectives:

_Students will be able to..._

- Specify suitable materials based on functional requirements.
- Specify suitable processes based on requirements of cost.
- Propose alternative materials and processes for a given design.
- Assess the relative impact of design choices on the environment.
- Present their implications of their choices visually using digital methodologies.

## Course Schedule:

### Week 1: Intorduction & Subtractive Methodologies

Students will begin the basic principles of milling and other machining processes. Whether manual mill via bridgeport 3 axis process, up to modern 6 axis CNC via HAAS etc. EDM “Electrical Discharge Machining (Wire & Plunge)”, its use cases and when one should or should not apply. Finally, “turning” via lathes and the benefits of each process.Discuss chip loading on end mills relative to material hardness.

Implications on metal wood and plastic: Which plastics are suitable for machining? Hardness relative to Steel and Aluminum.

Discussion of tooling cost and complexity vs cycle time and part cost.

Cad Demo and Assignment: Extrude & Revolve (additive and subtractive) Specific assignment should demonstrate understanding of difference between machined pockets and EDM (square corners, draft, etc as well as stress risers, difference in tooling setup between chamfer and radius edges. POSSIBLY a Fusion Milling simulation...
