## Course Description

### Bulletin Description:

This course focuses on materials, manufacturing methods and the application of this knowledge to the practice of Industrial Design. The course will introduce commonly specified materials, their properties, costs, and impacts on sustainability and commerce. The course will also study the relationship of specific manufacturing methods on formal and aesthetic compositions as well as their relationship of these choices to markets, users and overall product feasibility.

### Detailed Description:

This is a combination lecture/lab course covering the fundamentals of materials and manufacturing processes. Weekly lectures will be reinforced with digital modeling exercises directly associated to the lecture material. Topics will be introduced and discussed in terms of topology, mechanical properties, scale, sustainability and cost.

### Course Goals:

- To become familiar with the range of commonly specified materials.
- To become familiar with the range of commonly specified production processes.
- To understand the impact of scale on cost.
- To understand the impact of scale on sustainability.

#### Student Learning Objectives:

_Students will be able to..._

- Specify suitable materials based on functional requirements.
- Specify suitable processes based on requirements of cost.
- Propose alternative materials and processes for a given design.
- Assess the relative impact of design choices on the environment.
- Present their implications of their choices visually using digital methodologies.

##### Inclusion:

As a member of the Industrial Design faculty at Pratt, I am committed to supporting diversity and inclusion inside and outside of the classroom. I will endeavor to practice empathy, good listenership, patience, and openness to perspectives and contexts that are beyond my own. I hope that we can share the power to learn together while building towards a welcoming, rewarding, and supportive space for all. I seek to be flexible in my class to incorporate new understandings and lived experiences as they arise and encourage my students to do the same.
